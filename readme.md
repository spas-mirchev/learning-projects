# Learning projects

### Web UI applications

I built a few Web UI applications using Flask, SQLAlchemy, SQL, Flask-Login, Flask-Bootstrap, Werkzeug and OpenCV:

- [Todoapp](UI/todoapp)

  Create/complete/update and comment on tickets similar to Trello. It has multiuser authentication and all the data is persisted in a database.

- [Cafe workspace app](UI/cafe-workspace-app)

  Shows coffee shops on an interactive map. It plots server-side data using LeafletJS on the frontend. Thereâ€™s a backend filtering on features.

- [Dominant colours](UI/dominant-colors)

  Uses the K-Means Clustering algorithm to show the dominant colours on a user-uploaded picture. The user can control the number of colours to see.

### Terminal projects

I used `Tkinter` to build a few terminal applications:

- [Tic Tac Toe](Terminal/tictactoe-minimax)
- [Typetext](Terminal/typetext)
- [Watermark](Terminal/watermark)

### Data Science

See the readme in the [Data Science folder](Data%20Science) for more details.

Example work:

1. [Apriori](Data%20Science/recommendation_models/apriori.ipynb)
2. [Item Collaborative Filtering (CF) & User Collaborative Filtering (CF)](Data%20Science/recommendation_models/item_to_item.ipynb)
3. [Matrix factorization](Data%20Science/recommendation_models/collaborative_filtering.ipynb)
4. [Some experiments](Data%20Science/experiments)
